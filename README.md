<h2 align="center">Forking this repo üéØ (important ‚ö†Ô∏è )</h2>

<p>Some people have asked me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually <b>yes, with proper attribution</b>.

<p>I value keeping my site and it's code open source, but as you all know, <b>plagiarism is bad</b>. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied and pasted my site without giving me a bit of credit. I spent a huge amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! <br> <b>So, what I need to say is not to claim all of my effort as your own</b>.</p>
<p font-size="5px">[ Writing this kind of readme was an idea of <a href="https://brittanychiang.com/?ref=fahim.pages.dev" target="_blank">Brittany Chiang </a> ] </p>

<h5 align="center">And <b>yes</b>, you can always fork this repo. Just give me appropriate credit by attaching my portfolio link in appropriate area of your website.</h5>
<h4 align="center">For example: ¬© [year] , Your gorgeous name. All rights [ reserved/NARR ].<br>Designed and coded with huge ‚ù§Ô∏è by <a href="https://fahim.pages.dev/?ref=anonomous_user" target="_blank">Fahim</a> </h4>
  <h3 align="center">That's all I wanted to say!! Thank you! </h3>
